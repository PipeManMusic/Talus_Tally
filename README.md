## Dropbox Sync
The mobile app reads and writes `talus_master.json` in your Dropbox App Folder. Create the folder tree `Dropbox/Apps/Talus Tally/data/` on any device running the Dropbox client and place `talus_master.json` inside it. The Android build downloads that file at launch, overwrites the same path on save, and pushes rotating backups into `Dropbox/Apps/Talus Tally/data/backups/` so every device sees the full history.
